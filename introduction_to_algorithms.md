# Topics to learn:

## A) Get familiar with the functions to express complexity and understand at what point one complexity became more efficient than others
* Example: 
	* 1 comparing quadratic with logarithmic where 8n^2 and 64n lg n
	* 2 comparing quadratic with exponential where 100n^2 and 2^n

## B) Calculate the value of “n” in "lg n” in a second, minute, hour, day and month

## C) first algorithm: Insertion sort
* C-1) Understand concepts: loop invariant and proof of correctness (page 19)
	* Initialization
	* Maintenance 
	* Termination

## D) 2.2 Analyzing algorithms (page 23)
* RAM model
* running time (page 25)
* size of input (page 25)
* Worst-case and average-case analysis (page 27)
* Order of growth (page 28)

## E) The divide-and-conquer approach (30)
