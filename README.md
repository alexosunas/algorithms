# Algorithms study group
This is a roadmap to became proeficient in computational algorithms based on recomendations from teammates (software gurus) and some research in google, this guide is open to sujestions for modifications and inprovements.

## Books:

* 1 Introduction to algorithms (3rd edition)
* 2 Cracking the code interview (Last edition ?) Alternative: the algorithm design manual

## Websites to practice 
* https://www.interviewcake.com/
* https://www.codewars.com/dashboard

## Other resources to learn from:
* https://visualgo.net/en
* http://www.algorist.com/
* http://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~algorith/

# Recommendations:

Start with the book Introduction to algorithms (3rd edition).

You can follow the guide for that book in file:
`introduction_to_algorithms.md`

Also the excercises for that book couldbe found in "js" folder with the following name convention:
`z00x_int_to_alg-some_description.html` where x is a number of the excersise selected by the order of appearance in the book.
