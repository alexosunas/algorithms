// 1 Loop invariant: is the portion of the array that is already sorted determined by the index "i" in the subarray score[0.. score[i]]

// 2 Why does it need to run for only the first "n-1" elements?
// because the last element will not have other elements to be compared with.

// best and worst case scenarios are O(n^2) because always is going to iterate the array "n" times looking for the smallest number.
