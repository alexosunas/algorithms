//CRACKING THE CODING INTERVIEW
//Example: DIY page 70, given a smaller string s and a bigger string b, design an algorithm to find all perutations of the shorter string within the longer one. print the location of each permutation.

//This solution is from:
//https://gist.github.com/primaryobjects/2b9c5cab5d1459d8b22035893d8f8310
//and it turned to be a better solution than the one I had so, here it is for studing pourposes :)

//Special case: there is a missing permutation, the algorithm has to return back and review that case.
// let largeString = 'laoqloajf';

//Larger example also includes the special case
let largeString = 'zzalqofyrhfnflaoqloajfjnfmncmqoajdfheaqlo';
let smallString = 'aloq';

//Small string with different length, also include special case
// let largeString = 'aslqoalsdkjfgkldh';
// let smallString = 'aloqs';

//Book example
// let largeString = 'cbabadcbbabbcbabaabccbabc';
// let largeString = 'ccbabc';
// let smallString = 'abbc';
